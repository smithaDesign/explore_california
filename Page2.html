    <p> <span class="style2">WELCOME</span> to Lighthouse Baptist Church in Camp Verde, Arizona. 
      Thank you for visiting our website. Lighthouse Baptist Church was started in 2009 by <em>Pastor Don Randall Sr. and family</em>. Recently returned from Northern Ireland where they were missionaries for over twenty-nine years, the Randalls felt the Lord burden them to go to Camp Verde, Arizona, where there was a need for an Independent, Fundamental, Bible believing church. Even though LBC is a newer church we have already outgrown our first facility.<br />
      When you visit Lighthouse Baptist Church you will meet friendly people that <em>enjoy </em>worshipping and serving the Lord. The services are traditional with hymn style singing and the KJV Bible. We invite you to <em>join</em> us for a service and see Lighthouse Baptist Church for yourself.</p>

<div class="about">
 <span class="style2">The Bible Way to Heaven:</span><br />
      <strong>1.Recognize your condition.</strong>
  </h3>
  <p>For all have sinned, and come short of the glory of God. (Romans 3:23) None of us is good enough to go to Heaven on our own merit. Because   we are sinners, no matter how much good we do, we always fall short.</p>
  <strong>2. Realize the penalty for sin.</strong>
  <p>For the wages of sin is death... (Romans 6:23a) Just as there are wages for good, there is punishment for wrong. The   penalty for our sin is eternal death in a place called Hell.</p>
  <strong>3. Believe Christ died for you.</strong>
  <p>But God commendeth his love toward us, in that, while we were yet sinners, Christ died for us. (Romans 5:8) Christ showed His great love for us when He died on the cross to pay our sin debt.</p>
  <strong>4. Trust Christ alone as your Saviour.</strong>
  <p>...but the gift of God is eternal life through Jesus Christ our Lord. (Romans 6:23b)</p>
  <p>For whosoever shall call upon the name of the Lord shall be saved. (Romans 10:13) Everlasting life is a gift purchased by the blood of Jesus and offered freely to those who call upon Him by faith.  </p>
  <p>If you will trust Jesus Christ as your Savior, pray a simple prayer.   Prayer is simply talking to God. Tell Him that you know you are a sinner   and that you deserve to pay your own sin debt. Acknowledge that Jesus   died for you to pay the debt you owe, Today, as best as you know how,   you will trust Him as your Savior. You will depend on Him from this   moment on for your salvation. Ask God to help you live for Him and be a   good Christian.</p>
  <p>If you have trusted Jesus Christ to save you, <a href="mailto:donrandall11@gmail.com">please let us know by e-mail</a> or you can call 928-634-1008.  We'd like to be sure you have a Bible and help you grow as a new Christian. Once you are saved, you are saved for eternity.  You cannot lose your salvation. No creature or thing can take it away from you. </p>
  <strong>God says:  </strong>
  <p>I give unto them eternal life; and they shall never perish. (John 10:28)</p>
  <p>But as many as received him, to them gave he power to become the sons of God, even to them that believe on his name: (John 1:12)</p>
  <p>Therefore if any man be in Christ, he is a new   creature: old things are passed away; behold, all things are become new.   (2 Corinthians 5:17)</p>
